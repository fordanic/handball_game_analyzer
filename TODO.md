# Handball Insight TODO List

## Project Overview

Handball Insight is a Python-based application designed to analyze handball game videos. The primary objectives of this project are to detect and track the lines of the pitch, the ball, and the players, and to identify various events within the game (such as passes, shots, goals, free throws, yellow cards, suspensions, and penalty shots). The project will be developed iteratively, starting with individual images and progressing to longer video sequences.

## High-Level Tasks

1. **Setup and Environment**
    - [ ] Set up the development environment
    - [ ] Install necessary libraries and dependencies (OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)

2. **Data Handling**
    - [ ] Develop functions for loading and preprocessing video data
    - [ ] Create scripts for data augmentation (if needed)

3. **Pitch Line Detection**
    - [ ] Implement pitch line detection using edge detection (Canny) and line detection (Hough Transform)
    - [ ] Test and refine pitch line detection to handle variations in camera angles and line appearances

4. **Ball Detection and Tracking**
    - [ ] Implement initial ball detection using color and shape analysis
    - [ ] Enhance ball detection to handle scenarios with motion blur and non-distinctive ball colors
    - [ ] Implement ball tracking across video frames

5. **Player Detection and Tracking**
    - [ ] Implement player detection using color and shape analysis
    - [ ] Develop and test algorithms for tracking players across frames
    - [ ] Plan for and later implement jersey number recognition for more detailed tracking

6. **Event Detection**
    - [ ] Define visual and audio cues for key events (pass, shot, goal, free throw, yellow card, suspension, penalty shot)
    - [ ] Implement detection algorithms for each key event
    - [ ] Test and refine event detection for accuracy and speed

7. **Output and Visualization**
    - [ ] Develop methods to annotate videos with detected events and tracked objects
    - [ ] Create a 2D model of the pitch to project player and ball positions
    - [ ] Implement visualization tools such as heatmaps and trajectory plots

8. **Model Training and Optimization**
    - [ ] Collect and annotate datasets for training detection and tracking models
    - [ ] Train and optimize models for various detection tasks
    - [ ] Evaluate model performance and refine as necessary

9. **Testing and Validation**
    - [ ] Develop unit tests for all major functions and modules
    - [ ] Create test cases for end-to-end validation of the system
    - [ ] Conduct real-world testing with actual game videos

10. **Documentation**
    - [ ] Document the code and provide usage instructions
    - [ ] Create detailed guides for setting up and running the application
    - [ ] Develop user manuals and technical documentation

11. **Future Enhancements**
    - [ ] Plan for additional features and improvements based on user feedback
    - [ ] Explore integration with other sports analysis tools
    - [ ] Consider real-time processing capabilities
